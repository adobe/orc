# `graceful_exit` only matters when ODR violations are found. In such cases, when `graceful_exit`
# is `true`, ORC will exit(0), indicating success. Otherwise, the tool will return a nonzero value
# indicating failure. `graceful_exit` can be useful for older applications that are looking to track
# and/or reduce their ODR violations over time (versus enforcing zero violations.)
#
# Note that in the ORC output, the string "error" will be used if `graceful_exit` is `false`,
# or "warning" if `grace_exit` is `true`. 
#
# The default value is `false`.

# When an ODRV is found for a type, ORC will only report the first one if `filter_redundant`  is
# true. This is generally what you want. Set to false if you wish to see all the conflicts for 
# a given type, which can be useful when trying to identify a particular violation in code.
# If `parallel_processing` is true as well, the number of ODRVs reported can vary widely.

# Print the symbol paths as they are processed by ORC. Setting this value to `true` will result in

# `log_level` determines how loud ORC should be. The following values can be used, in increasing
# order of verbosity. The logging level does not affect ODR violation reporting.
#
#     'silent': no logging output
#     'warning': an avoidable issue that should be addressed
#     'info': emit brief, informative status
#     'verbose': copious amounts of information

# `violation_report` and `violation_ignore` are mutually exclusive lists of violation categories.
# A violation category is a pair of `tag:attribute` as reported when a violation is found. If you
# use `violation_report`, all ODRVs will be ignored except for those categories explicitly listed in
# the array. If you use `violation_ignore`, all ODRVs will be reported except for those categories
# explicitly listed in the array. Specifying both will yield an error, then `violation_ignore` will
# be used. If any symbols are ignored via `symbol_ignore`, those will be ignored before the
# report/ignore arrays are used.
#
# The default `violation_report` is a reliable tested set that is a good baseline.
